# Introduction

The Vote Up/Down module allows the user to cast votes on some entities in
a Drupal site with different widgets. This module uses Voting API to implement
votes and Chaos Tools to provide AJAX support and make custom widgets.

 * For a full description of the module, visit the project page:

# Requirements

This module requires the following modules:

 * Voting API (https://www.drupal.org/project/votingapi)
 * Chaos Tools (https://www.drupal.org/project/ctools)


# Features

 The module is implemented as a field, you may vote over any field-able entity, node, comment and term are examples of entities.


# Installation

 The module currently depends on a drupal core change from [#2670798-4:
 "nojs"/"ajax" route parameter in use-ajax link breaks CSRF
 protection](https://www.drupal.org/project/drupal/issues/2670798#comment-10868390).
 Please use that patch to improve a bit core ajax api, its full url is
 https://www.drupal.org/files/issues/drupal-exclude-csrf-paramaters-2670798-4.patch

 With current drupal core and current implementation, vote_up_down cannot support
 anonymous voting, details at [#2955847: Anonymous users can not
 vote](https://www.drupal.org/project/vote_up_down/issues/2955847).
 The Drupal core issue [#2730351: CSRF check always fails for users without a
 session](https://www.drupal.org/project/drupal/issues/2730351) is the
 underlying reason.
 The changes at
 [#2730351-57](https://www.drupal.org/project/drupal/issues/2730351#comment-11989824)
 enable it for Drupal 8.9.x.
 On Drupal 9.x.x, there is not any current solution yet that have been verified
 with this module, if you know one, please add a comment to [the related
 vote_up_down issue
 #2955847](https://www.drupal.org/project/vote_up_down/issues/2955847).

 Install as usual, see

# Customization

 You can write your own widget for Vote Up/Down, and you can put it in
  your module or in your theme. Please take a look to
  [WIDGETAPI.md](WIDGETAPI.md) for more information.

 ## Theming widgets and votes
   
 Since widgets are implemented through plugins, and we have many plugins
 to choose at runtime, we can not use direct theme templates, so instead
 we render by hands the templates.

 NOTE: It is not possible to decide dynamically the path where the
 template is located. In contrast we can dynamically define function and
 template names.


# Frequently Asked Questions

<!--- These needs to be changed but putting them as it as for now --->

How to display voting widget by API for nodes?::
If you want to custom how and where to show the widget, you need to
render manually each part of the standard node `$content` variable
(fields, body, etc).
```php
<?php
// save the rendered value of the widget
$vud_widget = $node->content['vud_node_widget_display']['#value'];
// avoid show it twice
unset($node->content['vud_node_widget_display']);

// render each value inside $content
print $node->content['body']['#value'];

// print vud widget, here is the place where we want to show it
print $vud_widget;

// render more values inside $content
```

How can I prevent bots to vote when anonymous voting is enabled?::
When anonymous voting is enabled, you need to modify your `robots.txt`
file to prevent bots to vote.
```
Disallow: /vote/
Disallow: /?q=vote/
```
