Widget API - Vote Up/Down
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Vote Up/Down has its own widget API that allows site implementors and designers
to easily use their own widget themes. Its easy as 1-2-3! Following are some
rules you must follow:

- All widgets are put in their respective sub-folders inside the widgets/
  subdirectory. So your widget theme is called "awesome", make a folder by the
  name of "awesome" such that its path is ./widgets/awesome

- The widget itself is themed by the API using the "widget.tpl.php" file. As
  soon as this file is created in your widget folder, it will displayed in the
  list of available widget themes. The theme system of Vote Up/Down outputs
  variables that you can freely use to display all sorts of widgets. The list of
  variables is given later.

- Apart from displaying the number of votes in the widget itself, you can also
  display the widgets in the "links" part of the node, comment etc. This is
  implemented in the theme using a separate theme file called "votes.tpl.php"
